Also, the mirroring function is not perfect, so a slight screen delay is sometimes felt. Still, I think the performance is decent for the price.

The design was clean and matched well with the Pixel phone, which was satisfactory. However, there were a few disappointing points while using it. First, the case material is more slippery than I thought, so I sometimes feel uneasy when holding the phone. This is especially true since I tend to have sweaty hands. It would have been better if the anti-slip treatment was more effective. Also, the corners of the case tend to wear out easily. I don't use my phone roughly, but a few scratches have already appeared. I wish the durability was a bit more enhanced. The delivery was relatively fast, but the packaging condition was a bit disappointing. There was insufficient cushioning material, so the case had slight scratches. I think this point needs improvement.
